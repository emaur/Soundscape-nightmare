Although this preview is not much, it’s displaying the introduction to my soundscape narrative. 
My character gets home for the day, closes the door to their apartment, sets their keys down on the countertop, 
removes their shoes, and starts doing coursework — hence the clicking of the keyboard. Since this is only my first 
preview of the assignment, we only then begin to hear sounds for the next scene, which consists of my character getting 
ready for bed; right now, I only have a clip of the sink running, but I plan on adding in next my character getting into 
bed, maybe briefly watching some TV, and then finally going to sleep. To represent my character entering into the dream 
state, I’m planning on including some enchanting, mystical, types of sounds and music. All of these mundane clips work to 
set the scene, help build the plot, but more importantly — these clips function to create this repetition which I’m trying 
to display in their actions. Leading up to the climax of the narrative, I’m hoping to repeat these ‘getting home, washing up,
getting into bed’ clips at least three times, but continuously speed them up to increase a sense of chaos and also excitement 
the character feels in preparation to lucid dream later that night. My character essentially becomes addicted to lucid 
dreaming, actively trying to do it each night, therefore everything else leading up to sleeping and dreaming increases in 
speed and decreases in time — working to highlight the actual dreaming within the narrative.
