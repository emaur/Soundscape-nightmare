"Dreamscape" follows one character through their daily routine: getting home, sending last-minute emails, washing-up for bed, and drifting off to sleep. They soon fall into a dream which quickly turns into a nightmare and wakes them -- only to find themselves unable to move in bed and terrorized by sounds of ghosts in the darkness.
